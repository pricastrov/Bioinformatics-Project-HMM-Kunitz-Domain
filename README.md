## ‚Äçüíª Overview

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results for a project focused on the identification of the **BPTI/Kunitz domain** using a structure-informed **Profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**. The model was constructed from structurally aligned domain sequences and evaluated for domain annotation performance.

## üìå Objectives

- Construct a profile HMM from structurally aligned Kunitz domain sequences.
- Evaluate its performance on positive and negative datasets using classification metrics.

## üõ† Installation

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `Python >= 3.13`
- `BLAST+ >= 2.16.0`
- `CD-HIT >= 4.8.1`
- `HMMER >= 3.4`
- `UCSF Chimera >= 1.20` (optional, for visualization)

## üöÄ Methodology

### üíø Data preparation (provided in data/)

**1. Retrieve protein sequences from [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot] (https://www.uniprot.org) with the following criteria:**
  ‚Ä¢ Taxonomy: _Homo sapiens_ (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 9606)
  ‚Ä¢ Reviewed: Yes
  ‚Ä¢ Pfam Domain: PF00014 (Kunitz-type protease inhibitor)

**2. Acquire the [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot] (https://www.uniprot.org/help/downloads) database file.**

**3. Obtain [PDB structures] (https://www.rcsb.org) with:**
  ‚Ä¢ Pfam Annotation: PF00014
  ‚Ä¢ Resolution ‚â§ 3.5 √Ö
  ‚Ä¢ Sequence Length: 45‚Äì80 amino acids

**4. Use CD-HIT to cluster sequences based on sequence identity:**

This is the command-line tool to cluster sequences based on sequence identity:

`cd-hit -i pdb_kunitz.fasta -o pdb_kunitz.clst`

‚úÖ -i pdb_kunitz.fasta
  ‚Ä¢ Input file: a FASTA file (pdb_kunitz.fasta) containing protein sequences for Kunitz domains extracted from the PDB.

‚úÖ -o pdb_kunitz.clst
  ‚Ä¢ Output file prefix.
  ‚Ä¢ CD-HIT will generate:
  ‚Ä¢ pdb_kunitz.clst: a FASTA file with the representative sequences.
  ‚Ä¢ pdb_kunitz.clst.clstr: a text file showing the cluster composition (which sequences belong to which cluster).

### üìè Multiple Structural Alignment

**1. Upload the IDs of the representatives of the clusters to [PDBeFold] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/cgi-bin/ssmserver), and select:** 
  ‚Ä¢ Submission form/3D alignment: multiple
  ‚Ä¢ Source: List of PDB codes
  ‚Ä¢ Submit your query

### üî¶ Construction, Validation and Evaluation of the Profile Hidden Markov Model

**1. Build the HMM Profile**

Build a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from a multiple sequence alignment using HMMER with the following command:

`hmmbuild pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.hmm pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.ali`

‚úÖ hmmbuild
  ‚Ä¢ This is an HMMER tool that builds a profile HMM from a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA or Stockholm format.

‚úÖ pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.hmm
  ‚Ä¢ This is the output file ‚Äî the HMM profile that gets created.

‚úÖ pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.ali
  ‚Ä¢ This is the input alignment file in FASTA format.

**2. Search for Kunitz Domains in positive and negative sequences against the profile HMM**

These two commands are running HMMER‚Äôs hmmsearch tool on  positive and negative datasets to identify sequences that match your Kunitz domain HMM profile.

`hmmsearch -Z 1000 --max --tblout neg_#.out pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.hmm neg_#.fasta` 

`hmmsearch -Z 1000 --max --tblout pos_#.out pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.hmm pos_#.fasta`

‚úÖ -Z 1000
  ‚Ä¢ Sets the database size used for E-value calculations to 1000. This standardizes E-values across different queries/datasets.

‚úÖ --max
  ‚Ä¢ Turns off all HMM heuristics and performs a full exhaustive search.
 
‚úÖ --tblout neg_#.out or --tblout pos_#.out 
  ‚Ä¢ Outputs the result in a concise, table format to neg_#.out or pos_#.out. Useful for automated parsing.

‚úÖ pdb_kunitz_nr_clean.hmm
  ‚Ä¢ The profile HMM you‚Äôre using for the search (in this case, representing Kunitz domain).

‚úÖ neg_#.fasta or pos_#.fasta
  ‚Ä¢ The FASTA file of negative sequences (not expected to have the Kunitz domain) or positive sequences (expected to have the Kunitz domain).

**3. Evaluate performance**

Run the performance.py script with a treshold sweep from 1e-1 to 1e-12 on both test sets to evaluate how performance metrics vary with different e-value cutoffs.

`for i in \`seq 1 12\`; do python3 performance.py set_1.class 1e-$i; done`

This runs the performance.py script using 1e-$i as the e-value threshold to classify predictions:
  ‚Ä¢ If e-value <= 1e-$i  ‚Üí predict positive.
  ‚Ä¢ If e-value > 1e-$i  ‚Üí predict negative.

The script then computes:
  ‚Ä¢ Confusion matrix
  ‚Ä¢ Q2 (accuracy)
  ‚Ä¢ MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)
  ‚Ä¢ TPR (True Positive Rate / Sensitivity)
  ‚Ä¢ PPV (Positive Predictive Value / Precision)

### üìä Results

The following graph illustrates the bahavior of the MACC value of the Set 1 (cyan) and Set 2 (fuchsia) for different e_values:

Final remarks:
‚Ä¢ Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): Up to 0.99
‚Ä¢ Optimal threshold: E-value of 1e-05-1e-06 showed the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.
‚Ä¢ Structural conservation: Disulfide-bridging cysteines were highly conserved, supporting domain specificity.
